# Character to Bits

**Character** to Bits is a Java 18 project designed to convert characters into binary bit patterns suitable for display on digital boards. The project generates header files ```(.h)``` containing bit arrays representing characters in either **8x8** or **16x16** pixel grids. These arrays can be used to render characters on digital displays, such as LED matrices or other pixel-based boards.

## üìå Features

- Converts Unicode characters to binary representations
- Supports both 8x8 and 16x16 output formats
- Outputs character data in `.h` header files
- Useful for embedded or low-level display systems
- Simple to extend with more characters or resolutions

## üîç How It Works

This project provides a simple and extensible way to convert **any character from any language** into a **bit-level representation**, suitable for rendering on digital displays like LED matrices.

### üß± Step-by-Step Process

1. **Character List Definition**  
   You start by providing a list of characters in any language (e.g., English, Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, etc.). These characters are stored and iterated through programmatically.

2. **Character to Image Conversion**  
   Each character is rendered onto an image (usually a monochrome buffered image) using a suitable font and size.

3. **Pixel to Bit Conversion**  
   The image is scanned pixel by pixel. For each pixel:
   - The **grayscale value** (intensity) is calculated.
   - A **threshold** is applied (usually average or fixed).
   - Pixels are then converted to **binary** (0 for black/dark, 1 for white/light).

4. **Formatted Output**  
   - The resulting bits are grouped into bytes or words (depending on 8x8 or 16x16).
   - These values are formatted into `.h` files as **hexadecimal arrays**, ready for integration with display systems.

5. **Generated Files**  
   For each character, two header files are generated:
    - For 8x8 grids: [CharacterSetName]_8x8.h
    - For 16x16 grids: [CharacterSetName]_16x16.h
    The file generation logic is implemented as follows:
```java
fileGen(8, 8, language, CharactersContainers.CHARACTER_ARRAY_NAMES[ind] + "_" + 8 + "x" + 8 + ".h");
fileGen(16, 16, language, CharactersContainers.CHARACTER_ARRAY_NAMES[ind] + "_" + 16 + "x" + 16 + ".h");
 ```

## Example: Character "‡¶Ö" (Bengali Letter A)

Below are examples of how the character "‡¶Ö" is represented in 8x8 and 16x16 bit patterns.

**8x8 Representation**

The 8x8 bit pattern for "‡¶Ö" is stored in a file named ```‡¶Ö_8x8.h```. The data is an array of 8 bytes, each representing one row of the 8x8 grid.

File Content Example:

```
0x00, 0x00, 0x10, 0xA8, 0x48, 0x7C, 0x06, 0x00, // ‡¶Ö
```

**16x16 Representation**

The 16x16 bit pattern for "‡¶Ö" is stored in a file named ```‡¶Ö_16x16.h```. The data is an array of 16 16-bit words, each representing one row of the 16x16 grid.

File Content Example:

```
0x0000, 0x0000, 0x0000, 0x0000, 0x7FFF, 0x000C, 0x63CC, 0x226C, 0x226C, 0x326C, 0x186C, 0x0FFC, 0x001C, 0x000C, 0x0000, 0x0000, // ‡¶Ö
```
